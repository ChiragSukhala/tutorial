Congratulations on completing the Tour!

You should now be able to load a schema into Dgraph's GraphQL API and perform
basic queries and mutations on it.

### Where to go from here

- Follow the
  [Build a Message Board App in React](https://dgraph.io/learn/courses/messageboardapp/react/overview/introduction/)
  course to put into application what you have learned.
- More in depth details can be found in Dgraph's
  [GraphQL API Documentation](https://dgraph.io/docs/query-language/).
- See [Deploy](https://dgraph.io/docs/deploy) if you wish to run Dgraph in your
  own environment.
- Take [Dgraph's DQL Tour](https://dgraph.io/tour/intro/1/) if you wish to learn
  Dgraph Query Language (DQL) which runs underneath the GraphQL API of Dgraph.
