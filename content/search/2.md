Dgraph supports RDF N-QUAD language tags of the form `"string"@lang`.  For example in a mutation
```
_:FIXME <name> "something"@en
_:FIXME <name> "something"@ch
```

A query may also ask for a language preference and may search based on a language preference.

Strings and queries are accepted in UTF-8, so there's a wide set of symbols (runes) to use in encoding strings.
