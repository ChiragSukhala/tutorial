Query variables in a child block allow the query to carry answers
matched at one level down to the children to filter against.

For example, take of the set of actors in all Jane Campion films; our
challenge is to find which pairs
in that set have acted together on a film not directed by Jane Campion.

Finding co-actors is easy and finding all actors on any Jane Campion
film we can already do, but to join them requires using the two sets
together.

Here, query uses the sets of all Jane Campion's films `JC_film` and
all actors in any Jane Campion film `JC_actor` in child blocks.

The `@cascade` directive ensures answers match all parts of the
query - otherwise, actors who had no matching co-actors could be
returned.  While `@normalise` makes the result only the aliased predicates.

The same query could have been writen using variables that span
multiple queries, but the graph traversal would be the same.
