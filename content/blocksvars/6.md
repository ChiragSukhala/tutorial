Two comon uses for variables are reorganising results to return
a different graph to the queried graph, and linking two queries to gain
some new insight based on the joined results.

The previous page was an example of the first: reorganising and
filtering genre based on a single actor's movies.

Let's now look at an example of the second.

For two directors find the actors who have worked with both (not
nescessarily on the same movie).  Many directors won't have actors in
common, so start with some you are sure will.

As an optional challenge, for each
of those actors list the movies they have made with either director.

   var(func: allofterms(name, "Martin Scorsese")) {
    F_MS as director.film {

        A_MS as performance.actor
      }

    actor: name

      performance.film @filter (var(F_PJ) OR var(F_MS)) {
      	name@en
      }
