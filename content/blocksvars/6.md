Two common uses for variables are reorganizing results to return
a different graph to the queried graph, and linking two queries to gain
some new insight based on the joined results.

The previous page was an example of the first: reorganizing and
filtering genre based on a single actor's movies.

Let's now look at an example of the second.

For two directors find the actors who have worked with both (not
necessarily on the same movie).  Many directors won't have actors in
common, so start with some you are sure will (the answer below uses
Peter Jackson and Martin Scorsese who have a small number of actors in
common).

As an optional challenge, for each
of those actors list the movies they have made with either director.

   var(func: allofterms(name, "Martin Scorsese")) {
    F_MS as director.film {

      }

  }

  actors(id: var(A_PJ)) @filter(var(A_MS)) @cascade {
    actor: name
    actor.film {
      performance.film @filter (var(F_PJ) OR var(F_MS)) {
      	name@en
      }
    }
  }
