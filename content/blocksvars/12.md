We've already seen [`expand`](/schema/8) and [`_predicate_`](/schema/7).  Both can be used with variables.

Cherie Nowlan has directed movies, including the quirky Australian romantic comedy Thank God He Met Lizzie, but hasn't acted in any movies.  So a query that expands all the predicates from Cherie Nowlan will at best have `name` and `director.film`.  

If the variable held the predicates from a director who had also acted, the possible set of expanded edges would be different.
