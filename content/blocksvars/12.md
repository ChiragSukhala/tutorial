{{% notice "note" %}}
  GroupBy isn't in release 0.7.6.  It'll be in the next release, or you can grab the latest nightly build and use that.

A `groupby` query aggregates query results given a set of properties on which to group elements.  For example, a query containing the block
```
director.film @groupby(genre) {
  a as count(_uid_)
}
```
finds nodes reachable along the `director.film` edge, partitions these into groups based on genre, then counts how many nodes are in each group.  

Inside a `groupby` block, only aggregations are allowed and `count` can only be applied to `_uid_`.

The result is the grouped edges and the value variables for the aggregations.  

In this case the value variable is a map from genres to values.

Often, it's necessary to use `groupby` with another query to obtain values other than aggregations.
