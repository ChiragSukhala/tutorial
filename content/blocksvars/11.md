Write a query to find the most recently released movie by each director and order the result by the release dates.  

If you need some hints try:
{{% expandable %}}
To solve this, you'll need to

* work out how to query for all directors - what have directors done that make them directors?
* find the most recent release date for each director
* sort the results by the most recent release
* return the directors name, and the details of the most recent release
* you'll need one query to get the directors and their latest movies, and another query to sort this to get most recent movies first
* for something extra, try using `since` to work out how many days since the movie was released (or how many days till release, for some)

```
{ # Get all directors
  var(func: gt(count(director.film), 0)) @cascade {
    director.film {
      date as initial_release_date
    }
    # Store maxDate as a variable
    maxDate as max(var(date))
    daysSince as math(since(maxDate)/(24*60*60))
  }

  # Order by maxDate
  me(id: var(maxDate), orderdesc: var(maxDate), first: 10) {
    name
    days : var(daysSince)

    # For each director, sort by release date and get latest movie.
    director.film(orderdesc: initial_release_date, first: 1) {
      name
      initial_release_date
    }
  }
}
```
