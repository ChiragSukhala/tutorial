  Filtering on value variables wasn't in release 0.7.6.  It'll be in the next release, or you can grab the latest nightly build and use that.

If the context provided by the UIDs of the block is correct, value variables can also be used in filtering and ordering.

Here, `ID` will be the UID's of all directors of name Steven and `average` is a map from those UID's to the average for each director.  The filtering, ordering and result for `var(average)` are evaluated in that context to obtain each value.

A value variable can be used in place of a UID variable, in which case it evaluates to the UID's in the map.  For example, the `avs` query block could be written:
```
avs(id: var(average), orderdesc: var(average)) @filter(ge(var(average), 40)) @normalize {
```
