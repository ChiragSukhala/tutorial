We've just looked at variables that stored `uid` results from query
blocks.  In much the same way, value variables store the lists of values against which they
match.

Value variables allow min, max and a host of aggregation functions.

Aggregations over value variables aren't dependent on an index -
there's no need for indexing, the values are already found in the query.

`min` and `max` can be applied to `int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`,
and `date` types.
