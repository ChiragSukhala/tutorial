Queries can be issued as multiples.

For queries labelled `q1, ..., qn` issued as a multiple query block, the JSON
result will contain labelled answer blocks `q1, ..., qn` for each query.

If a block is labelled with `var` no results are returned for that
query.

The visualisation here finds the overlap in the two queries based on
`uid`, but the JSON contains the complete answer for each query.

So In this case we are visualising the overlap between two distinct
queries.

Query variables are one of the most powerful features of  GraphQL+-.
Query variables allow the answers from one block to be
used in another, joining the two queries.  You'll learn about query variables in the following lessons.
