Each graph edge is unidirectional. It points from one node to another. A lot of times, you wish to access data in both directions, forward and backward. Instead of having to send edges in both directions, you can use the @reverse keyword at the end of a uid (entity) field declaration in the schema. This specifies that the reverse edge should be automatically generated. For example, if we want to add a reverse edge for directed_by predicate, we should have a schema as follows.

```js
func Foo(bar Bar) error {
  return bar.Do();
}
```
