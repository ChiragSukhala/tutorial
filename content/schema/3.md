Itâ€™s also possible to specify an id for nodes using the syntax
```
<my_unique_node_id> <name> "This is an XID"
```
Such id's are called external id's or XID's.

Dgraph still creates its internal `uid` for these nodes and a mapping
from the XID to the `uid`, but not the other way around.

XID's can be used, for example, in Linked Open Data where nodes can be
assigned a URI as an identifier, or when importing data that already has
identifiers.

Querying directly for a node can then be done with either the XID or
the `uid`.

Note that, as of the current release, collisions in the XID to `uid`
mapping aren't checked for, that's coming in a future release.
