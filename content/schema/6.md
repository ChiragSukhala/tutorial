For any nodes in the graph `_predicate_` queries for all outgoing
edges.

Note that this is different to a schema or intent in designing a graph
because any given node might or might not have all the predicates that
other nodes have.

For example, in the our friends dataset, not all people have pets.
But more generally, large graphs often represent a partial view of the
modeled data.  Our job in analysis of the data is to understand the
relationships in the data while dealing with gaps or incomplete knowledge.
