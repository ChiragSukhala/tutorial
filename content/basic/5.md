Dgraph query results are graphs.  In fact, the result structure matches the query structure.  You might have noticed that the structure of our query about Michael’s friends matched the structure of the resulting graph.

Edges in the query to other nodes signify part of the query that matches nodes found along such an edge.  So we can expand our general query structure to

```
query_name ( some selection criteria ) {
	list of edges to select values
	edge e1 to another node {
		edges to match with nodes found along e1
	} 
	edge e2 to another node {
		edges to match with nodes found along e2
	}
}
```

We can continue to nest the query as we follow edges to other nodes.

It’s good style to indent the query.

Something to try : can you change this query to find Michael’s friends pets rather than Michael’s pets.

The idea is to formulate the query that represents the graph structure
you want as an answer.

(can I embed a hidden answer that only comes up if they click it
... they could then copy and past into the query screen??)
```
{
  michael_friends_pets(func: allofterms(name, "Michael")) {
    name
    age
    friend {
        name
        owns_pet {
            name
        }
    }
  }
}
```
