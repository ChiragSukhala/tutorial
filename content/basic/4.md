Dgraph query results are graphs.  In fact, the result structure matches the query structure.

Edges in the query to other nodes signify part of the query that match nodes found along such an edge.  We can continue to nest the query as we follow edges to other nodes.

Compare the JSON result to the structure of the query.

It’s good style to indent the query.

Something to try : How about Michael’s friends' pets, or Michael's
friends' friends.

The idea is to formulate the query that represents the structure
you want as an answer.  The `uid`'s in the JSON output allow
interpretation as a graph rather than a tree.  See, for example, the
cycles in Michael's friends' friends.
