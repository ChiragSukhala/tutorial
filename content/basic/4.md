Dgraph query results are graphs.  In fact, the result structure matches the query structure.

The braces `edge_name { ... }` in the query
signify nested blocks where the edges inside the block are matched
against  nodes found by following the edge that begins the block.
We continue nesting the query as we follow edges from node to node.

It’s good style to indent the query.


Compare the JSON result to the structure of the query and note, for
example, that the `friend` edge matched a number of nodes and each is
represented in the JSON.


Something to try : How about Michael’s friends' pets, or Michael's
friends' friends.


{{% expandable %}}
```
{
  michael_friends_pets(func: allofterms(name, "Michael")) {
    name
    age
    friend {
      name
      owns_pet {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```  
{{% /expandable %}}


The idea is to formulate the query as a traversal
through the graph, following edges to the desired data.  The `uid`'s in the JSON output allow
interpretation as a graph rather than a tree.  See, for example, the
cycles in Michael's friends' friends.
