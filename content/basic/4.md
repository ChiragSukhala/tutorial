It’s time to talk about data types and nodes

There was some magic in the last query because some of the queried edges returned a value (name and age), but some returned nodes (friend) that themselves had further properties.

The truth is that there is a schema to tell us how to interpret what an edge leads to.

Run the query to the right and find out about the schema of our example.  The visualisation won’t be much use here, just look at the JSON.

There are really two kinds of nodes in a graph, let’s call them nodes and values (or literals).  A person is a node and may have a name edge to a string value.  A value can’t have any edges coming out of it.

Dgraph has lots of types you can use to store values.

[list of schema types here]

There’s one more type, uid, for nodes.  So the schema tells us the friend edge goes from one node to another, not to a value.

There's lots more about schema later in the tutorial [link].  For now, we know more about our graph and the types of things in it.
