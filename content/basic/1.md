At this point you should have Dgraph up and running in the tutorial container and know what a graph is.

The panel to the right contains a visualisation of part of a graph.  It’s the familiar social network example and we’ll use this data for the next few steps in the tutorial before we ramp up to bigger datasets.

You can zoom in and out and navigate around the visualisation.  Hover over the nodes to get more information about them, and you can rearrange the graph to suit how you want to view it.

Have a look at the data, get comfortable with the ideas and connections in it and when your ready, move on and look at how to write graph queries
