Ordering might not seem important for a graph.  

But you might want to select only the top-k answers, paginate the
results for display, or limit a large result.

In GraphQL+- this is done with `first`, `offset` and `after` in
combination with ordering.


* `first: N`  return only the first `N` results

* `offset: N`  skip the first `N` results

* `after: uid`  return the results after `uid`


By default, query answers are ordered by `uid`.

`after` makes sense in pagination when we know the last `uid` returned
previously and for example don't record how many results have
previously been retrieved.
