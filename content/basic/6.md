In GraphQL+- queries, we can put restrictions at any level to select what nodes are returned.  So our general query structure becomes

```
 query_name ( some selection criteria ) {
	list of edges to values select
	edge e1 to another node @filter( some selection criteria ) {
		edges to match with nodes found along e1
	} 
	edge e2 to another node {
		edges to match with nodes found along e2
	}
}
```

We call this filtering.  There are many functions we can use in filtering, some of them are

[table of functions and what they do]

Something to try : test out some filters.  String filtering is a bigger topic and it’s got its own section in the tutorial [link]

Functions can only be applied to predicates that have been indexed - that’s part of another lesson [link]
