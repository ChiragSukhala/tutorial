Let’s have a look at a first query in GraphQL+-.   Let's start with
the general structure of a query

```
query_name ( some-selection-criteria ) {
	selected-edges
	...
}
```

Normally, to run a query you’d need to post it to a Dgraph server or use a Dgraph client for the programming language you’re using.  For this tutorial, let’s focus on just the query text and you can learn about posting [link] or programming with Dgraph [link] another time.

Press run to execute the query and check out the result either as JSON or in the visualisation.

Every query is named and that name determines the name in the result.

A query searches for nodes that meet search criteria.  In this case, nodes with a name edge with value Michael.

For nodes that match the criteria, the listed edges specify what to return.

So this query finds nodes with name Michael and returns the name and age edges for those nodes.


Something to try : Go back and look at the sample data again.  Change the query to select someone else’s data.
