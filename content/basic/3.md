The last query got us some data, but the result wasn’t very interesting, nor was it much to do with graphs.

One of the important things about Dgraph and GraphQL+- is that queries return graphs, not tables or lists of data.

So a query is executed against a graph and the result is a graph that represents the result of the query - that might be a subset of the queried graph, or some manipulation of the original graph.

Let’s improve the query to get Michael and his network of friends.  

The query to the right now asks for Michael, his name and age, and the name of anyone connected to Michael by the friend edge.

Run this query and have a look at the resulting graph.

Something to try : Change the query to also return Michael’s friends ages.
