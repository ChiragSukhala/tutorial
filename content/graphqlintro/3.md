Dgraph generates a spec compliant GraphQL API endpoint complete with CRUD operations ingesting a simplified GraphQL Schema comprised of types.

You can copy the schema provided in the editable code block we have provided and paste it into the Schema input on your Dgraph Cloud instance.

To make this easier for you, we have created this editable code block that can push a Schema to your Dgraph Cloud instance if authorized with an Admin API Key. To generate this Admin API Key, click on "Settings" on your Dgraph Cloud instance and select the "API Keys" tab. The API Keys page on Dgraph Cloud enables you to create new keys and delete existing keys. CLick on "Create New". Name the key anything that will help you identify it later such as 'tutorial'. Ensure that Admin is selected and then click "Create". Copy the API Key and paste into the form below.

<!-- API Key shortcode here that writes the API Key to localstorage/cookie -->
