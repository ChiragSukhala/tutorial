So far in this tour you have deployed a Dgraph database and ran a few mutations creating data and ready to continue the tour, but first things first: What is a graph and what has that got to do with databases?

Graphs describe objects and the interconnections between them. THe basics understanding originates with simple Geometry and connecting points to form shapes.

You may have heard of friendship graphs, or a social network graph, where data points of people are connected together through known relationships.

Press run on the query to the right. In the reulting graph, circles denote nodes being people and animals and lines denote connections or labeled relationships between them.

Graphs lend themselves so naturally to visualizations that you'll find yourself thinking in terms of graph and visualizations of them.

Graphs aren't just for social networks other examples include:

- Interconnected data, like SQL tables requiring joins
- Advanced search
- Recommendation engines
- Pattern detection
- Network, like computers, roads, telecommunications
- Processes, like business and biological processes
- Events and the causality or other links between them
- Structures of firms or markets
- Modeling of Geographic or 3D objects

These and the many more applications of graphs lead us to graph databases.
