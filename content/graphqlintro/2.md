You can run an instance of Dgraph on your local supported machine, but to make this tutorial easier to follow along with for all users, we will use Dgraph Cloud.

Dgraph Cloud is a database as a service (DBaaS) provider. Dgraph Cloud enables you to focus on using your database instead of deploying and managing the hardware and server environments.

Dgraph Cloud offers three service tiers to support your database needs as your database needs grow. For this tutorial we will be using a Starter (Free) instance. The Starter instance can be launched for free with a 1 Mb daily data transfer limit. Dgraph Cloud also offers Slash GraphQL (Shared) and Cloud (Dedicated) instances that are pay plans starting at $9.99/mo.

To get started sign up on [cloud.dgraph.io](https://cloud.dgraph.io). Once you are logged in, you will be prompted to launch a new backend. Select the Starter (Free) instance, and "Launch".

Launching a new backend will take a few minutes to allocate the services and deploy your environment. Once deployed, Dgraph Cloud will provide you with a GraphQL Endpoint URL.

Copy the GraphQL Backend Endpoint URL and paste it below. We will use this GraphQL Endpoint URL for the remaining of this tutorial.

{{% savedinput "Endpoint URL" "graphqlendpoint" %}}https://your-endpoint.location.provider.cloud.dgraph.io/graphql{{% /savedinput %}}

 In the next step of this tour, we will be submitting a schema to your backend. This tour application can automate this process if authorized on your backend with an Admin API Key. To generate this Admin API Key, click on "Settings" on your Dgraph Cloud instance and select the "API Keys" tab. The API Keys page on Dgraph Cloud enables you to create new keys and delete existing keys. Click on "Create New". Name the key anything that will help you identify it later such as 'tutorial'. Ensure that Admin is selected and then click "Create". Copy the API Key and paste into the form below.

{{% savedinput "API Key" "apikey" "true" %}}Your Secret Admin API Key Here{{% /savedinput %}}

If you close this window, the endpoint URL and API Key will not be saved for security reasons. We recommend copying the API Key to a safe place for further reference or else you may need to generate a new API key next time you access the tour.
