Dgraph at its core is a loosely typed database, and can be used in a NoSQL-like schemaless fashion. GraphQL provides a strongly typed API that is served from the core of a Dgraph database.

All other GraphQL databases apply GraphQL as a layer served above the database, but starting with Dgraph 20.03, Dgraph brings GraphQL into the core of the database itself. Dgraph was developed around the GraphQL syntax and benefits greatly from its easy to use structure.

GraphQL provides an API that is

- Strongly Typed
- Simple to Query
- Easy to Traverse
- Flexible to Itirate Upon
- Poficient with Busines Logic
- Capable of 3rd party Data Integration

The GraphQL API provides an endpoint to ask for exactly what you want and receive the results exactly as you expect them to be.
