Welcome to GraphQL powered by [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io).

This interactive tutorial will get you up and running with Dgraph database and
get you started writing queries in GraphQL. 

{{% notice "note" %}} To take a tour of Dgraph using Dgraph Query Language, (DQL - formerly known as GraphQL+-), please see the [DQL-focused portion of the tutorial]({{< relref "intro/1" >}}). The first five
 sections of this tutorial focus exclusively on using Dgraph Cloud with GraphQL. {{% /notice %}}

The tutorial is divided into modules. You can access the table of
contents at any time by clicking "A Tour of Dgraph" in the top left and can move backwards
and forwards using the right and left arrows at the bottom of this pane.

In this tutorial, you can run queries and mutations. The tutorial will guide you
from your first graph query to creating more advanced queries.

After completing this self-contained tutorial, please see the reference material
available to help you use Dgraph in the [Dgraph Docs](https://docs.dgraph.io),
and on [Dgraph Learn](https://dgraph.io/learn).
