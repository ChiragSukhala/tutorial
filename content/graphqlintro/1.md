Hi,

Welcome to GraphQL powered by [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io).

This interactive tutorial will get you up and running with Dgraph and writing
graph

queries in GraphQL, an endpoint generated from a Dgraph database.

{{% notice "note" %}} If you are looking for Dgraph's Query Language, DQL
(Formerly known as GraphQL+-), please start at
[Dgraph DQL Tour](https://dgraph.io/tour/intro/1/). Condintuing this tutorial,
we will use GraphQL exclusively. {{% /notice %}}

In this tutorial, you can run and interace with the queries and mutations.

The tutorial will guide you from your first graph query to queries a graph
expert would be proud of.

As well as this self contained tutorial, there's lots of reference material to
help you use Dgraph in the [documentation](https://docs.dgraph.io) and on
[Dgraph Learn](https://dgraph.io/learn)
