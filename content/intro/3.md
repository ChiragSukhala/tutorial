First things first: what’s a graph and what’s that got to do with databases? 

Graphs describe objects and the interconnections between them.  Many people have heard of friendship graphs, or social network graphs, so let’s start there.

Press run for the query to the right. In the resulting graph, circles denote people and pets, and lines denote connections or labelled relationships between them.  Hover over the circles and see if you can find Michael and his pet sheep, Rammy.

<!---The graph could be represented as a picture, written down as text or stored in a graph database. -->
Graphs lend themselves so naturally to visualisation that you’ll find yourself thinking in terms of graphs and visualisations of them.

In a graph, the objects (or entities) are called nodes and the relationships are called edges or predicates. 

Graphs aren't just for social networks.  Other examples include

* Customers and products purchased
* Networks, like computers, roads and telecommunications
* Processes, like business and biological processes
* Events and the causality or other links between them
* Structures of businesses or markets

These and the many more appliations of graphs lead us to graph databases.
