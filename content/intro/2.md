Let's run an instance of Dgraph on your machine, so you can get a
handle on installing Dgraph and loading data yourself.

Install Dgraph with

```
curl https://get.dgraph.io -sSf | bash
```

or if you want to inspect the scripts

```
curl https://get.dgraph.io > /tmp/get.sh
vim /tmp/get.sh  # Inspect the script
sh /tmp/get.sh   # Execute the script
```

It's easy to start Dgraph; just run the command

```
dgraph
```

That's it!

Alternativelt, you could install and run with [Docker](https://docs.dgraph.io/v0.7.5/get-started/#docker-image-installation).

Dgraph will now be running and listening on it's default port `8080`.
There are more options, but that's all we need to get started.
