Get Dgraph up and running.

(not sure here … are we running it locally for the duration of the tutorial?)

To make running this tutorial self contained, well get an instance of Dgraph up and running for you … just do ????

You can install and run Dgraph yourself using the instructions here [link], but for this tutorial it’ll just work in the browser

verify that all is working well by pressing run in the panel to the right
??have some sort of welcome message node to display something??
