Let's run an instance of Dgraph on your machine, so you can get a
handle on installing Dgraph and loading data yourself.

Install Dgraph with

```
curl https://get.dgraph.io -sSf | bash
```

or if you want to inspect the scripts

```
curl https://get.dgraph.io > /tmp/get.sh
vim /tmp/get.sh  # Inspect the script
sh /tmp/get.sh   # Execute the script
```

It's easy to start Dgraph; just run the command

```
dgraph
```

That's it!

Alternatively, you could install and run with [Docker](https://docs.dgraph.io/v0.7.5/get-started/#docker-image-installation).

Dgraph will now be running and listening on it's default port `8080`.
There are more options, but that's all we need to get started.

Once you have Dgraph up and running, press run on the panel the
right.  This will load a simple dataset into Dgraph for us to use in
the first steps of the tutorial.  Don't worry too much about the
syntax for now, we'll cover all that in later lessons, just check in
the JSON tab that the operation was a success.
