A graph database is a database optimised for storing and querying graphs.  When it comes to relationships, graph databases are much faster than SQL databases.

SQL databases get bogged down by graph-like data because following
edges means joining tables; sometimes big tables; the more edges, the
more joins, and the more data needs to be loaded and processed.

In a graph database, the edges are the fundamental structure, so following edges is fast.

Dgraph is a graph database.  It’s optimised to store graph data and to query it fast.  More than that, it’s designed to scale to huge graphs across many machines.

With Dgraph, you can store a graph on a single computer with millions of edges, or you can store massive graphs that require a whole data centre to process.
