Results can be ordered using the `order` argument on edges and `query<Type>`
query functions.

When applying ordering the visualization of the graph remains unchanged, but the
JSON response returned will contain an ordered list.

The generated `<type>Order` input type accepts three arguments:

- `asc` - Sort by a field in ascending order
- `desc` - Sort by a field in descending order, and
- `then` - Add an additional sort argument.

In the example query we provided in the editor, the query queries all nodes of
the type Person and sorts those nodes by the `name` field in ascending order.

Something to try: Sort Alice's friends by their age in descending order and then
by their name in ascending order.

{{% expandable %}}

```
{
  getPerson(xid: "alice") {
    id
    name
    friends(order: { desc: age, then: { asc: name } }) {
      id
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```

_FYI, This query will fail on Dgraph versions prior to 21.03_
{{% /expandable %}}

For every type, Dgraph will generate a list of fields that are orderable. Edges
to other nodes are not orderable fields within a type.

To introspect the available order fields, inspect the generated
`<type>Orderable` enum.

```
{
  __type(name: "PersonOrderable") {
    name
    enumValues {
      name
    }
  }
}
```
